Part IV.

  Is mergesort stable?  Yes
  Why or why not?       It will always iterate over every element in the list for log(n) time;

  Is quicksort stable?  No
  Why or why not?		When the list size is small, the choose of pivot can determine the performance of quicksort 	                      algorithm. If the pivot can divide the list into three equal-size sublist, the number of iterate 	                      over evey element will reduce from n(worst case) to log3(n);
